# Final Portfolio Project - Alex B.

## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Alexandre Barragan. I am a Junior at Mt Eden High School. My goal in this class was to get an A in both semesters. I love science a lot, especially Chemistry and Computer Science. I hope to major in any subject soon.

## 📚 What This Project Is

This portfolio project represents everything I have gone through in this class. We have gone through many experiences, especially through these 3 projects I am presenting along with this website. With the use of HTML, CSS, and JS, I have been able to craft what I am presenting today.

- An **About Me** section highlighting who I am
- A **Projects** section showing off all the projects I've done
- A **Contact** section, just in case you want something from me
