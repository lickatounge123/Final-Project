        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Alexandre Barragan</strong>, a Junior at Mt. Eden High School. This site showcases my AP Computer Science projects. Throughout the year, I've worked with C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This site is built primarily with HTML and CSS. I would also like to thank Mr. Gary Alvarado for teaching me along this journey.</p>
